#shape-or-colour

This is a single player only version of the Italian [board game](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6818/forma-o-colore) which is also known as Forma O Colore or OXXO.

I don't speak or write Italian so finding info on this game was difficult. The following are the rules as I understand them from typing text from [this image](http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1157827/forma-o-colore) into google translate.

##Rules

One of the players will be the *form* player. The other player will the *colour* player.

###Goal
The goal of the *form* player is to get four pieces in a row with the same symbol (X or O). The goal of the *colour* player is to get four pieces in a row with the same colour.

The form player plays with the 8 white pieces.
The colored player plays with the 8 colored pieces.

The form player goes first.

On each turn, each player can make one of the following two types of moves :

1. Place in an empty slot one of their previously unused pieces.

2. Flip over one of their pieces which has already been placed.

Once a player has placed all their pieces then they may only make the second type of move.

The victory of both players is not possible.
Players cannot make a move that would result in a line of four of the same *colour* **and** *form*.
